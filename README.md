# COMP250-FINAL-TESTER
# Disclaimers
- Please only add TEST CODE here, not actual assignment code. If you accidentally pushed your assignment code, please delete ASAP to avoid any inconveniences.
- Otherwise, happy coding and debugging!

# Using the leaderboard
#### Uploading
To upload your score, run the tester with POST_RESULT set to true and TIMEOUT_MILLIS at 60000. You will be prompted to enter your McGill email.

#### Viewing the scores
To view the existing scores, run Leaderboard.java.

# How to Start
#### Leaderboard
- Download the leaderboard code by going to Releases and clicking on LeaderboardUploader.jar
- Add the JAR to your project
  - In Eclipse: Right-click on your project > Build Path > Add External Archives...
#### Source code and puzzles
- [Recommended] You can clone this repository. Sasha made an excellent (and quick) guide to doing this: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFvevpoGcNCvjyTjOfPhzqjgb-L_WdX8r
- If you'd like to avoid Git, you can download all the code and puzzles by clicking â†“Code > Download ZIP. 

In either case, you must add your own ChessSudoku.java file to the finalproject package.

# Installing
For IntelliJ IDEA users (recommended)
VCS -> Get from Version Control... -> Paste the URL of this repository

For Eclipse users (if you like suffering)
File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from Git (With Smart Import) -> Clone URI -> paste URL of this repository into the URI box -> Click next a bunch, setting directory at your own discression, Master branch from origin. All else default -> Finish

For both:
Drag your .java files from the assignment into the tester package.
Regularly update the tester (pull the repository) to get any new tests that might have been uploaded.
